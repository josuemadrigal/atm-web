          Having an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) can offer various benefits,
          such as providing convenience to customers by offering easy and quick
          access to banking services 24/7. Additionally, it reduces the load on
          bank branches, improves efficiency in transactions, and facilitates
          cash withdrawal in diverse locations, which is particularly useful in
          emergency situations.
